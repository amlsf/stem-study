# A Data Analysis of College Women in STEM Studies

## Harvard AC209 Data Science - Fall 2015

This repository includes all relevant files for our final project.

- iPython process book: `process_book.ipynb`
- Data: The `data` subfolder includes the (clean) dataset that was used in our analysis. The original 2010 US Census microdata is too large to include here, but can be accessed [here](https://copy.com/31nVAgdrBtZcgADm) (~zipped, 1.28GB). Links to intermediate datasets saved at various stages of the data wrangling process are also included in our process book.
