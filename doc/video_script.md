Imagine you're sitting in a college classroom. Look to your left. Look to your right. Who do you see?

Now imagine you're sitting in a science or math class.... Let's take a closer lookâ€¦  

While over half of college students in the US are women, reports estimate only ONE IN FOUR are earning degrees in science, technology, engineering and math (that's STEM for short).

Why is this the case? We're not the only ones asking this question. But the reason the answer is important is clear: increasing diversity in STEM enriches creativity in collaboration, and broadens the scope of innovation.

For our project, we looked to 2010 US Census microdata -- **spanning 3 million records in total** -- for answers. We set out to use this data to predict whether a college student is likely to major in STEM or not, based on a variety of both individual and household-level factors.

We focused most of our attention on the 13,000 college undergraduates with a declared major, and on 22,000 others sharing the same household.

We discovered some interesting trends. For example, of these college students, 60% were female. However, when we look just at those female students, only 13% are in STEM majors.

We also built models to help us identify specific factors most likely to be associated with female students who study STEM:

- Cultural ties can make it more likely a young woman will study STEM... or not.
- To our surprise, having attended private school appears to decrease the likelihood of majoring in STEM.
- And perhaps most importantly, our analysis shows that living with someone who has studied STEM -- usually a family member -- strongly suggests the student herself might be studying STEM.

We interpreted this critical finding as more broadly indicating the importance of **role models**. It's not enough just to encourage girls to study STEM, we must also actively encourage potential role models to be leaders - who can show these young women ALL that is possible.
